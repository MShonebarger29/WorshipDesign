            <h2>Why is it Important I should Focus on Worshipping God, and not care what people think, care, or do?</h2>
            <p>This is a very good, and important question to know. If we care what people thinks, talking about if they think for highly, the purpose is ruined. We need to be focusing on worshipping Christ and Christ alone. We should not be scared what people think of us while we are worshipping. If they think badly let them think badly. We can't control people's opinions. The only thing we can control is ourselves, so don't focus on other people focus on God. He desereves all of our praise.</p>

            <h2>What are Ways Some Ways I Can Worship Jesus</h2>
            <p>What are Ways I Can Worship Jesus? </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Singing</strong>There are lots of Christian music out there. You can find some and listen to it throughout your day. Examples of Christian music: All Hail King Jesus, Grattitude, Awake my soul, Back to Life, ext.</li>
                <li><strong>Reading Your Bible</strong>Reading your Bible is a really good way of getting to know God and His voice. We can learn to tell what He says for us to do and what He says not to do.</li>
                <li><strong>Talents </strong>God has given each of us our own special talents, that makes us diffrent. Not everyone has the same exact talents. We should use our talents to glorify God.</li>
                <li><strong>Prayer</strong>Prayer is talking to God. We shoudl talk to God daily, thanking Him, praying for others, and talking to Him about our life. Yes, God knows everything, but He still wants us to talk to Him.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As we gather to worship Jesus, let us do so with grateful hearts, open minds, and a deep sense of reverence for the One who gave His life for us.</p>

        <h2>Why is it Important That I Know Worship isn't About Leading?</h2>
        <div class="leading-importance-answer">
            <p>Praising/worshipping God should not bring glory to oursleves. We are lost without Christ, so whytake the glory from God. He deserves all of the glory. Instead of focusing on leading we should be more focused on worshipping God. Worship is not about leading. Worship is about worshiping God. No matter who is leading its still worship. No matter who is leading, worship.  </p>
